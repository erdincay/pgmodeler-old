This document describes a simple way how to compile and run the pgModeler.
Please read it carefully so that no step is forgotten compromising the 
entire process.


---------------------
**     WARNING     **
---------------------

Although this is a small fixes package of the first version of pgModeler
it is recommended NOT EXPORT directly to production environments the models created.
Not all possible code generation were tested in this way, is its your own risk export the
models into environments that are not intended for testing.
The project's author is not responsible for any possible loss of data due the inappropriate
use of this tool.

-------------------------
Installation Requirements
-------------------------

* GCC Development Tools
* Qt 4.7.x library or above (qt.nokia.com)
* LibXML2 library (www.xmlsoft.org)
* libpq library (www.postgresql.org)

----------
Compiling
----------

Before starting the compilation, check in the file 'pgmodeler.pro' if the variables
GLOBAL_INCLUDES and GLOBAL_LIBS points to the correct paths relative to your system.
Change the value of these variables only in the section for your operating system.

To compile the pgModeler type (in the root folder of the source code):

$ qmake pgmodeler.pro
$ make

If the build is successful the executable 'pgmodeler' will be created in the build/ directory.
Copy it to the folder you want and do not forget to also copy the folders schemas/,
conf/ and lang/ in the root directory of the project.

---------------------
Environment Variables
---------------------

By default pgModeler accesses the folders schemas/, conf/ and lang/ on the working directory,
but you can change this settings. Three own environment variables are used for this purpose.
If you want to configure directories cited in deferent paths use the following variables:

   PGMODELER_SCHEMAS_DIR -> stores the full path the directory schemas/
   PGMODELER_CONF_DIR -> stores the full path the directory conf/
   PGMODELER_LANG_DIR -> stores the full path the directory lang/

Additionally, the pgModeler need to know where to find the libraries required for the
execution (Qt Library, LibXML and libpq) for which you should enter the full path in the variable
LD_LIBRARY_PATH (Unix) or PATH (Windows), if not already configured.

To provide the interface translation pgModeler checks the variable LANG (Unix). For use
a specific translation, change the value of this variable. So far, the pgModeler only supports the languages
Portuguese from Brazil (pt_BR) and U.S. English (en_US).

Finally, as a form of convenience, the script 'start-pgmodeler.(sh | bat)' was created to assist
the initialization of pgModeler so it is not necessary to call the executable directly or change the
environment variables on your operating system.

Note: You may need to edit the parameters of the script depending on configuration of your operating system.

Change History
--------------

[ v0.1.1 ]

* Correction of the actions for inserting graphic objects (table, text box, vision and relationship)
  in Windows environment (ticket#2)
* Fix on the display of the maximize button in the window decoration in Windows environment (ticket#2)
* Adjust on the position and spacing of widgets in editing forms (ticket#2)
* The XML parser can now correctly read DTD files in Windows environment (ticket#1)
* The compilation method is no longer in the form of shared libraries + executable and passed
  to be as standalone executable only
